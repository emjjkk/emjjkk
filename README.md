I'm a uni cs student currently specializing in full-stack webdev. I work mostly with Javascript- (NextJS, Astro) and Python- (Flask, Django) based frameworks. I also build other things like discord bots, chrome extensions, and mobile applications with React Native. When I'm not coding, I'm probably studying. If it's neither of those, I'm playing games (ZZZ, Valorant, The Finals, etc.), doing tiktok edits @khydsai.fx, or sleeping peacefully.

**Some projects**

- [Dreamweaver](https://github.com/emjjkk/Dreamweaver) - AI image generation discord bot that runs on edge.
- [Vistab](https://github.com/emjjkk/Vistab) - Minimal, modern new tab for chrome.
- [dictionary](https://github.com/emjjkk/dictionary) - Simple, clean dictionary web app.
