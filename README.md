Thanks for visiting - you must really have a lot of time on your hands-

Heyo, I'm a college student and software developer based (at least for now) in Rwanda, currently focusing on full-stack web development. I'm familiar with Javascript- (NextJS, Astro, Remix, etc) and Python (Flask, Django) based frameworks for web development. I can also build cross-platform mobile apps with React Native and other things like discord bots, chrome extensions, and tampermonkey scripts. 

(Kinda) fun facts about me: I'm biracial (half thai, half nigerian)! If i'm not coding you'll most likely find me gaming (Valorant, Strinova, etc). I'm a big fan of all things speed - hopefully one day I'll get to drive a Mustang GTD.

#### Side projects I plan to build this year
- [OpenCode](https://github.com/emjjkk/opencode): AI website builder [MVP]
- [Flixd](https://github.com/emjjkk/flixd): Movie and TV show search and review app - kinda like letterboxd [WIP]
- Fluent: Social blogging platform & CMS
- Serval: Discord based gamified economy built on simultated crypto trading
- Stage Infinite: Esports fantasy-betting platform with in-game currency

**I offer really (like super duper) affordable web development  services (Landing pages, ecommerce, blogs)!** Reach out on whatsapp (+250 724 684 275), Email [alabiemmanuel029@gmail.com](mailto:alabiemmanuel029@gmail.com), or Discord (for more casual jobs) @emjjkk.
