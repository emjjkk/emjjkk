College student and software engineer from thailand currently based in Rwanda. At the moment I mostly do full-stack web development with NextJS or Django. I also build mobile apps, discord bots, and other things. I mostly work with Javascript and Python-based frameworks. Whenever I'm not coding you'll find me leaning Unreal Engine or playing videogames. I'm most active on Discord @e.mjjkk but you can find me on instagram and tiktok under the same username too.
